# FlexRL

FlexRL is a fork of [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) that offers a bit more flexibility while still being non-modular. FlexRL introduces the following features:
- Notebook-friendly interface
- A few custom environments

> **NOTE**: This repo is mainly for research and educational purposes. For now we only have PPO and we may gradually include more algorithms and custom environments.
